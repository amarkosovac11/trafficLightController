# trafficLightController
## **Introduction**
Traffic light controllers are critical systems for controlling the flow of traffic in intersections for the safety and efficiency of vehicles and pedestrians. In this project, I designed and implemented a two-way traffic light system using Logisim, a digital logic simulator. This controller toggles between two sets of traffic lights, one initially red and the other initially green. It changes the states periodically to simulate basic functionality of a real traffic light controller. The objective of this project is the ability to make a workable simulation of a traffic light controller by highlighting how timing and state management are important in digital systems. Some of the fundamental concepts developed in this project are state machines, synchronization, and logic design.
## **My Work**
The traffic light controller circuit successfully manages the flow of traffic across four intersecting roads by alternating the lights (Green, Yellow, Red) in a synchronized and automated sequence. The system utilizes a finite state machine (FSM), driven by a clock signal, to ensure precise timing and logical transitions between states. This guarantees that the lights for all four traffic directions operate in harmony, preventing conflicts and ensuring smooth traffic flow.
The design incorporates a mode selection feature, controlled by a digital input pin (J), which allows the system to adapt to varying traffic conditions. In normal mode (J=0), all traffic lights follow equal timing intervals for their respective Green, Yellow, and Red phases. In delayed green mode (J=1), the system adjusts the timing to extend the green light for certain directions, enabling prioritization of high-traffic roads or reducing delays at quieter intersections.
To enhance safety, the circuit ensures that at no point do conflicting directions simultaneously have a Green light. The FSM is carefully designed to enforce these safety constraints, with transitional Yellow phases providing clear indications before switching states.
The inclusion of this adaptive mode highlights the flexibility of the system, making it suitable for both busy urban areas and quieter rural intersections. Additionally, the system lays a solid foundation for future enhancements, such as integrating pedestrian crossings, dynamic traffic prioritization using real-time sensors, or incorporating emergency vehicle prioritization mechanisms.
Overall, this design demonstrates the power and practicality of digital logic in addressing real-world traffic management challenges, offering a scalable and robust solution for modern transportation infrastructure.
